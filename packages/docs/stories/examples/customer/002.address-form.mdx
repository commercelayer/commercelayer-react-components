## The new address form

To allow the customer to add a new `customer_address`, we can build an `Add new address` form, using the following components:

- `BillingAddressForm`
- `AddressInput`
- `AddressInputSelect`
- `AddressCountrySelector`
- `AddressStateSelector`
- `SaveAddressesButton`

<span title="Core API" type="info">
  The form will create a new resource `address` and a new `customer_address` relationship with the `customer` resource.

  To better understand the logic behind the form, be sure to be familiar with the following resources:
  - [Customers](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api/resources/customers/object)
  - [Addresses](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api/resources/addresses/object)
  - [Customer Addresses](https://docs.commercelayer.io/core/v/api-reference/customer_addresses/object)
</span>

The `BillingAddressForm` component is demanded to setup the form related provider and context, enabling children components to interact with them.
<span title="Requirements" type="warning">
  It needs to be wrapped inside an `<AddressesContainer>` component so it will know where to save the address data.

  This means the our form will be structured as follows:
  <Source dark code={`
  <CommerceLayer accessToken='customer-orders-access-token'>
    <CustomerContainer>
      <AddressesContainer>
        <BillingAddressForm>
          // ...fields
        </BillingAddressForm>
        <SaveAddressesButton />
      </AddressesContainer>
    <CustomerContainer />
  </CommerceLayer>
    `} language='jsx' /> 
</span>

For each address field that needs to be saved there will be a form field component along with its related `Errors` block.

To render the field inputs we will use the following components: `AddressInput`, `AddressCountrySelector` and `AddressStateSelector`

### Code implementation
The following block of code implements all the components described above and is ready to be used in your project.

Every time submit the form, a new `address` will be created and listed in the recap underneath (the `<Address>` component).

<Canvas of={Stories.SampleAddressForm} />


### Customize the Country and State list of options
The `AddressCountrySelector` and `AddressStateSelector` components are used to render an input `<select>` with a default list of countries and states.
While the library offers a comprehensive list of countries, it specifically includes state options only for the `United States` and `Italy`.

If a country is selected and no state options are available, the `AddressStateSelector` component will render a simple input field instead of a dropdown menu, allowing users to manually input the state.

You can customize both the lists of countries and states by passing the `countries` and `states` props to their respective components, as demonstrated in the following example:

<Source dark code={`
// shows only FR, IT, US with localized labels as selectable countries
<AddressCountrySelector
  name='billing_address_country_code'
  countries={[
    { value: 'ES', label: 'Espana' },
    { value: 'IT', label: 'Italia' },
    { value: 'US', label: 'Unites States of America' }
  ]}
/>

// shows states as select with predefined options for France
<AddressStateSelector
  name='billing_address_state_code'
  states={{
    FR: [
      { value: 'PA', label: 'Paris' },
      { value: 'LY', label: 'Lyon' },
      { value: 'NI', label: 'Nice' },
      { value: 'MA', label: 'Marseille' },
      { value: 'BO', label: 'Bordeaux' }
    ]
  }}
/>
`} language='jsx' /> 

### Add metadata field to the address
You can add a metadata field to the address by using the `AddressInput` or `AddressInputSelect` component setting your key in the `name` prop adding the prefix `metadata_`.

If you want to set a metadata field as required, you have to set the `requiredMetadataFields` prop to the `SaveAddressesButton` component, passing an array of the required metadata fields keys as strings,
as shown in the following example:

<Source dark code={`
// Add a metadata field to the address
<AddressInputSelect
  name='billing_address_metadata_type'
  options={[
    { value: 'Mr.', label: 'Mr.' },
    { value: 'Mrs.', label: 'Mrs.' }
  ]}
/>
// or
<AddressInput name='billing_address_metadata_type' />

// Set metadata fields required
<SaveAddressesButton
  label='Save Address'
  requiredMetadataFields={['metadata_type']}
/>
`} language='jsx' /> 

<span title="The &lt;Errors&gt; component" type="info">
  As you might notice, every input has a correspondant `Errors` component that is used to print validation error during form submition.

  This component is tied up to a specific resource and field, so it will print the error only if the field is invalid, for that specific resource.

  For example `<Errors resource='billing_address' field='billing_address_phone' />` will print the error messages only if the `billing_address_phone` field is invalid.
  <br /> 
  It's possibile to customize/localize the error message by passing a `messages` prop to the component, as the following example shows:

  <Source dark code={`
  <Errors
    resource='billing_address'
    field='billing_address_phone'
    messages={[
      {
        code: 'EMPTY_ERROR',
        resource: 'billing_address',
        field: 'billing_address_phone',
        message: 'Cannot be blank'
      },
      {
        code: 'VALIDATION_ERROR',
        resource: 'billing_address',
        field: 'billing_address_phone',
        message: 'Must be valid email'
      }
    ]}
  />
  `} language='jsx' />

  This logic is applied to all fields that need to be validated, for both `EMPTY_ERROR` and `VALIDATION_ERROR` code.
  <br />
  <strong>
  To simplify the form example in this page, we omitted the `messages` prop for all `<Errors>`, but you can just copy the example above and implement it for every field.
  </strong>
</span>



### Usage with 3rd party UI libraries (eg: Material UI)
The address components can be easily integrated with 3rd party UI libraries, such as Material UI via children by setting the `props.parentRef` as React ref to the final input element that will be rendered.

The following example shows how to use the `AddressInput` component with Material UI's `TextField` component.
