# Building a customer account page

This guide will show you how to create a customer `My Account` page using our `react-components` library.

In general, the customer account page is a page where your customers can see and manage theirs personal information, addresses, orders, and so on.

In order to access these info, the customer will need to be logged in. This means that you need to authenticate the `<CommerceLayer>` component with an access token
that belogs to an user. 

You can find more information about how to authenticate the `<CommerceLayer>` component in the [Authentication](/docs/getting-started-authentication--docs) section.

In your project you might want to have everything related to the customer in one single page, in different sections of the same page, or even in different pages.
But to better showcase the components we are going to use, we divided the customer account page in 3 sections:

- Order list
- Add new address form
- Address address book

<span title="Important" type="info">
  Before jumping to the details for each section and see how our `react-components` can be used to build the customer account page, we recommend you to 
  check our API reference and read more about the <a href="https://docs.commercelayer.io/core/v/api-reference/customers" target="_blank">customer object</a> 
  and <a href="https://docs.commercelayer.io/core/v/api-reference/customers/list#relationships" target="_blank">its relationships</a>
