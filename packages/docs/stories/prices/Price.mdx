# Price

To display the price of your products with localized currency, discounts, and personalization rules, as shown in the code snippets below.

Each price has an amount (the actual selling price) and an optional compare-at amount (the full price that you want to display to the customer â€” typically with a strikethrough).

This component is the owner of the price information. It fetches the price of the specified SKU and dispatches it to the cl-price-amount children.
