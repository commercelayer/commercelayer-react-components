# Containers and hierarchy

Understanding the components hierarchy is important to understand how to use this library.

All components need to be wrapped inside the main `<CommerceLayer>` context that handles the authentication.
**It needs to be placed at the top of the application**.

Other components need to be wrapped inside their specific containers in order to access to the specific context.
As example the `<Price>` component needs to be wrapped inside the `<PriceContainer>` or it won't work.

<span type="info">
To avoid multiple requests to the API, the library uses a cache system that stores the data in those React contexts that we name containers.<br />
Less re-rendering of those containers means better performance and less requests to the API.
