# Containers

Getting used to the components hierarchy is important to understand how to use this library.

All components need to be wrapped inside the main `<CommerceLayer>` context that handles the authentication with the API layer.
**It needs to be placed at the top of the application**.

Other components need to be wrapped inside their own containers in order to access to their specific context.
As example the `<Price>` component needs to be wrapped inside the `<PriceContainer>` or it won't work.
At the same time, the `<PriceContainer>` will not render any HTML since it just holds the data for the `<Price>` component.

<span type="info">
To avoid multiple requests to the API, the library uses a cache system that stores the data in React contexts that we refer as containers.<br />
Less re-rendering of those containers means better performance and less requests to the API.
</span>


## Hierarchy
Each container documentend in the Components section of this guide, highlights a list of **Requirements** and **Children** that are needed to make it work.

Example:

<span title="Requirements" type="warning">
Must be a child of `<CommerceLayer>` component.
</span>


<span title="Children" type="info">
`<OrderNumber>`
`<TotalAmount>`
`<PlaceOrderButton>`
</span>
