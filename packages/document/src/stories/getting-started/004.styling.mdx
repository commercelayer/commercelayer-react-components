# Styling the components

This library does not provide any styling. They return simple html/jsx tags filled with fetched data. 

**<u>It is up to you to style the components as you want</u>**.

Almost all components expose a `className` prop that allows you to add your own css classes.
Some components that renders multiple elements also expose other props to add classes to each specific elements.

All the examples in this documentation use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to demostrate how the components can be styled.
