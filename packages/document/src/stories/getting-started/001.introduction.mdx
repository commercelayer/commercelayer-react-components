A collection of reusable React components that makes it super fast and simple to build your own custom commerce UI, leveraging Commerce Layer API.

Under the hood, our React components are built on top of [Commerce Layer JS SDK](https://github.com/commercelayer/commercelayer-sdk) â€” feel free to use it if you want to develop your custom ones.


## Installation

This library is [open sourced](https://github.com/commercelayer/commercelayer-react-components/) and served as [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercelayer/react-components) and need to be installed as dependency inside your project.


    <Source
          language="bash"
          dark
          code={`
// npm
npm install @commercelayer/react-components

// yarn
yarn add @commercelayer/react-components

// pnpm
pnpm add @commercelayer/react-components
`}
        />


## Import components into your project

You can use ES6 named import with every single component you plan to use (in addition to `CommerceLayer` one), as follow:

    <Source
          language="jsx"
          dark
          code={`
import { CommerceLayer, ...otherComponents } from '@commercelayer/react-components'
`}
        />

But you can also leverage treeshaking by importing only the components you need from its folder using either default or named export, as follow:

    <Source
          language="jsx"
          dark
          code={`
import OrderContainer from '@commercelayer/react-components/orders/OrderContainer'
// or
import { OrderContainer } from '@commercelayer/react-components/orders/OrderContainer'
`}
        />
