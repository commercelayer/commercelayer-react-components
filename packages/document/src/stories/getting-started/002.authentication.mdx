# Authentication

To get started with **Commerce Layer React Components** you need get the credentials that will allow you to perform the API calls they wrap.

All requests to Commerce Layer API must be authenticated with an [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) bearer token. 
Hence, to use these components, you need to get a valid access token. 


## Getting an access token
<span title="Important note" type="warning">
If you are new to Commerce Layer, we suggest you to read the [Overview of Commerce Layer's OAuth 2.0](https://docs.commercelayer.io/core/applications) guide.
</span>

There are many ways to get an access token and the one you choose depends on your specific needs.

You can get an access token by using one of the following methods:
- [API/OAuth requests](https://docs.commercelayer.io/core/authentication/client-credentials#getting-an-access-token) (i.e. `curl` or `postman`)
- [Commerce Layer CLI](https://github.com/commercelayer/commercelayer-cli)
- [Commerce Layer JS Auth Library](https://github.com/commercelayer/commercelayer-js-auth)

<span title="Suggestion" type="info">
If you want to retrieve the access token from the **command line**, we suggest you to use the [Commerce Layer CLI](https://github.com/commercelayer/commercelayer-cli) 
using the `commercelayer application:login` command ([view example](https://github.com/commercelayer/commercelayer-cli/blob/main/docs/applications.md#commercelayer-applicationslogin)), 
followed by `commercelayer application:token`

<hr />
Otherwise, if you need to get it from a **web application**, you can use the Commerce Layer JS Auth library that works both in the browser and in Node.js environments.

## Configure the `CommerceLayer` component
Once you got it, you can pass it as prop to the `CommerceLayer` component, as follow:

<Source
  language="jsx"
  dark
  code={`
import { CommerceLayer } from '@commercelayer/react-components'

const App = () => (
  <CommerceLayer accessToken="your-access-token">
    {/* ... child components */}
  </CommerceLayer>
)
`}
/>


This token will be used to authorize the API calls of all its child components. 
That's why the presence of (at least) one `CommerceLayer` component is mandatory — it must wrap every other component you need to use.

<span title="Multiples tokens" type="info">
In case you need to fetch data with different tokens (i.e. from different organizations or using apps with different roles and permissions) 
— nothing prevents you from putting as many `<CommerceLayer>` components you want in the same page.
